Getting Started
***************


Preliminary Setup
=================
Before attempting to use the repository you will need to setup your development environment and machine.

Install VSCode
--------------

Install the Recommended VSCode Plug-Ins
---------------------------------------

* `Bash Beautify`
* `Bash Debug`
* `C/C++`
* `code-groovy`
* `Docker`
* `Native Debug`
* `Python`
* `Python Preview`
* `Pylance`
* `Preview`
* `reStructuredText`
* `vscode-icons`
* `XML Tools`


Repository Setup
================
To get started working in the *ExOrg QA* environment, you will first need to clone the git repository.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd (source-tree-folder)/
    git clone git@github.com:exorg/exorg-qa.git exorg-qa
    cd exorg-qa

After you clone the repository, you will need to rehome the repository so the workspace task and
debug configurations work properly in your VSCode development environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    setup/rehome-repository

After rehoming your repository, you will also need to make sure all the dependencies are installed and
configured on your machine, in order for it to support the automation environment.  This is done by running
the setup script.

.. code-block:: bash

    setup/setup-machine

After you have setup the machine and rehomed the repository, you can open an automation workspace by
opening the workspace located at.

.. code-block:: text

    (repository)/workspaces/player_automation/player_automation.code-workspace

Note that the file above will not exist if you have not rehomed the repository.  You will only see ".template"
files in the workspaces folder until you re-home the repository.


Automation Environment Setup
============================
Once you have setup the repository and your development machine.  You can open the *player_automation.code-workspace*
in VSCode.  You will be asked if you trust the code in the repository, you will need to select *Yes*.  You might also
be asked to accept workspace settings, you should accept those also.

At this point you are very close to being able to run automation code, but you still have one last thing to do.
You must setup the python virtual environment used by the automation code.  This can be done in two ways.  You can
run the VSCode task by selecting **Run**->**Task** as shown below.

When you click the **Task** menu item, then tasks menu will be shown.  You will select the task named 
**Environment - Setup** or **Environment - Rest**.

The reset task is used if you need to reset an environment that was previously setup.  It bypasses checks
which see if the virtual environment already exists.

The second way to setup the virtual environment is from the commandline.  From the repository folder you can run
the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    automation/integration/setup-environment

After you have setup the environment, you are setup to run code.  You can find out how to configure the
automation environment by looking at the `Automation Configuration` page.
